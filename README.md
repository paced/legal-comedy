# Legal Comedy Chrome Extension

This extension:

- Adds a Verified checkmark next to everybody's name on Twitter.
- Removes the pop-up when clicking on the Verified checkmark so you can't tell who is actually verified.

It does not affect any search rankings or add any other features found in Twitter Blue.

## Build Instructions

With Node installed:

```shell
npm installl
npm run build
```

Then you can load the extension in Chrome by going to `chrome://extensions` and loading the repo.

## Disclaimer

This is a satirical statement about Twitter and not an attempt at circumventing its paid products. It is a classic 
example of free speech, something that Twitter claims to support.

This extension has no affiliation with Twitter, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries.

This was a speedrun hackathon project of sorts, and support as Twitter changes is not guaranteed. Feel free to report 
bugs if you see them, though.
