## Disclaimer

This is a satirical statement about Twitter and not an attempt at circumventing its paid products. It is a classic 
example of free speech, something that Twitter claims to support.

This extension has no affiliation with Twitter, Inc. or any of its subsidiaries.

This was a speedrun hackathon project of sorts, and support as Twitter changes is not guaranteed. Feel free to report 
bugs if you see them, though.
